    <h3>1. Get TO Know Me</h3>
    <p><h4>Hii this is Anup Tiwari,</h4> I'm a passionate and curious Software Engineering student with a strong interest in building meaningful and efficient software solutions. 
    <p>I'm currently pursuing my degree in Software Engineering, where I've been developing my skills in programming, web development, and problem-solving. From coding my first "Hello World" to working on collaborative projects, I've discovered how much I enjoy turning ideas into working applications.
    </p> 
    <p>I'm especially interested in web development, AI, cybersecurity, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks.</p>
        <p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me exploring tech blogs, working on side projects, or collaborating with fellow students to bring cool ideas to life.I'm looking forward to contributing to innovative projects, growing as a developer, and making an impact in the tech world.</p>
            <p> Let's connect!</p>
